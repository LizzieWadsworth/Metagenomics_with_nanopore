# Run FastQC

FastQC is a tool we can use to inspect the quality scores of our reads. 

To do this: 

1.  Go to Tools 
2.  Type in and select FastQC 
3.  Under "Raw read data" select the folder (collection) option and then your list of sequences
4.  Select "Run Tool"

I've made a GIF below to show you how to do this:

Whenever you run a tool it will be: 
  
- Grey when it is waiting to run 
- Orange while it is running 
- Green when it is done
