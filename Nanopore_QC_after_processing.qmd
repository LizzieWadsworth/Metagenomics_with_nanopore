# Nanopore QC after processing 

Now we've done our preprocessing steps, we can redo the FastQC and MultiQC quality checks to see how our final read qualities are. 

## What to use for inputs 

For FastQC, use the the result from Fastp (Read 1 Output) as input.

For MultiQC, select "FastQC", and then use select the FastQC on collection: RawData as input.

## Outputs 

You should get similar outputs that you did previously, but you should notice the reads are now only within the 1000-2000 bp range and the sequence quality remains high.
