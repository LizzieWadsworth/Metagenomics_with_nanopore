The first thing to do is to [go to the galaxy project](https://usegalaxy.org/register/start) and make an account. 

_Make a note of your Galaxy email address and password somewhere secure!_

The Galaxy project is a free web-based tool for running bioinformatics analyses. 

It runs on a _remote computer_ which means you can run large jobs overnight and you don't need to keep your own computer on, just check back later!
