# FastQ Groomer 

Following BBMerge, we need to reformat the reads using FastQ Groomer. 

From Tools, type in and select "FastQ Groomer"

Under "File to Groom", select collection (folder) option: 
-  Select your BBTools: BBMerge on collection (**merged** reads)

Make sure you've chosen the merged and not the unmerged reads. 

Keep everything else as default, and then click Run.
