# Why preprocess 

The reads we have downloaded from the Sequence Nucleotide Archive or European Nucleotide Database are the **raw** results that have come out of the sequencing machine. 

We need to process these reads to do a few things: 
  
-  CutAdapt: Remove any sequencing adapters from our reads 
-  CutAdapt: Trim low quality reads with CutAdapt, to remove possible sequencing errors. 
-  BBMerge: Merge our forward and reverse reads, to get one longer (and higher quality) read. 
-  FastQGroomer: Reformat the result from BBMerge to something we can use 
-  QC after processing: Rerun FastQC and MultiQC to get our quality after these processing steps.
