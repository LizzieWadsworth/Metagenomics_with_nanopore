# Fastq format

Our sequencing format has a quality score (how confident we are that each base is correct) as well as the sequence. 

It can do this because all our sequences (in FastQ format) look like this:

```

Each sequence in a fastq file is 4 lines long:

1.  Line 1: a header - a unique identifier for each read (begins with @)
2.  Line 2: the DNA sequence
3.  Line 3: a `+` to separate the sequence and quality scores
4.  Line 4: the quality score for each base in the DNA sequence. There are more scores than there are letters, so a mix of letters numbers and symbols are used to code for the quality score. 

We can use tools such as FastQC to visualise the quality scores across the whole sample - as we can't tell just by looking at them!
