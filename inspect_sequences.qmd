# Inspect sequences 

The history you've been given contains a **collection** of **paired** reads. 

Each sample is tagged with identifying information, for example: 
  
- #Healey2018 (the paper)
- #HighFibre (the patient condition)
- #Prebiotic (the experimental condition)

Some tags may have more or less information depending on how much information the paper had. 

Each sample is made up of two sequencing reads: a forward and reverse sequence. This is because sequencing quality decreases along the length of the reads, so we sequence each fragment of DNA in both directions. 

You can view the individual read pairs by clicking the collection, and see the sequences by clicking the "eye" icon. 

You don't need to do anything further here - we'll use tools to tell us about what these datasets look like.
