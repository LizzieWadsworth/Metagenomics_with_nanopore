# Inspect sequences 

The history you've been given contains a **collection** of reads. Nanopore reads are **single** (one long read) and Illumina reads are **paired** (split into two, one forward and one reverse)

Each sample is tagged with identifying information, for example: 

#LSD1 - Lizzie St Dunstan's Meadow 1  

You can view the individual reads by clicking the collection, and see the sequences by clicking the "eye" icon. 

You don't need to do anything further here - we'll use tools to tell us about what these datasets look like.
