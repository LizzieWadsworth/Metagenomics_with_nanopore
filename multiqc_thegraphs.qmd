# The MultiQC Graphs

The graphs for MultiQC are similar to those for FastQC but are combined for you reads. While we have paired reads, this will combine all forward reads and all reverse reads. We'll do this again after we've merged the reads, which will give us one value for every sample. 

## General Statistics 

MultiQC gives you a useful overview of your samples: 


| Sample Name | Dups | GC  | Seqs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
forward | 	98.1% | 54.0% | 0.1M | 
reverse	 | 98.1% | 53.0% | 0.1M | 

## Sequence counts 

A count of unique and duplicate reads. Because we're looking at a PCR amplified genes, we expect lots of duplicates!

## FastQC: Mean Quality Scores 

Mean quality scores for the reads.

## Overrepresented sequences 

You'll also get a table of overrepresented sequences. These are all part of the **_conserved region_** of the 16S rRNA gene so are in all of our samples!
