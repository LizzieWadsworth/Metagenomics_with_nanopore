# CutAdapt 

To run CutAdapt, go to Tools and Type in "CutAdapt"

Then select these options: 

1.  Single-end or Paired-end reads?: Paired collection
    -  Choose your collection of Downloaded sequences as the input. 
2.  In “Other Read Trimming Options”
    -  “Quality cutoff(s) (R1)”: 20
3.  In “Read Filtering Options”
    - “Minimum length (R1)”: 20
4.  In “Additional outputs to generate”: Report

After CutAdapt has run, it will generate: 
  
- CutAdapt Reads: The trimmed reads, which we will use in the next step 
- CutAdapt Report: A report showing you how many reads were trimmed

Now we've trimmed the reads, we can merge them...
